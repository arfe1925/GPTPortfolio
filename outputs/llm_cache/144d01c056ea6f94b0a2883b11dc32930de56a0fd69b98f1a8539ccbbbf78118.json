{"scores": {"valuation": 0, "quality": 60, "income": 0, "balance": 30, "technical": 0, "overall": 18}, "reasoning": "Valuation is poor due to high price-to-book ratio. Quality shows moderate profitability but income is weak with a negative dividend yield z-score. Balance is negatively impacted by low liquidity ratios despite manageable debt. Technical indicators are all negative, indicating a weak trend. Overall score reflects the combination of these factors."}
