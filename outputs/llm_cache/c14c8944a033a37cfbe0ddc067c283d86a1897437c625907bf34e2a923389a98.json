{"scores": {"valuation": 62, "quality": 30, "income": 50, "balance": 30, "technical": 40, "overall": 42}, "reasoning": "Valuation is decent with positive z-scores, but quality and balance metrics are weak, indicating profitability and leverage issues. Income is neutral due to missing data. Technicals show mixed signals with some positive trends but overall low scores. Overall score reflects the balance of these factors."}
