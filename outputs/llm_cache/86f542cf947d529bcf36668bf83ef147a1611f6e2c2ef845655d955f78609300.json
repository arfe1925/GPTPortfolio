{"scores": {"valuation": 56, "quality": 78, "income": 50, "balance": 53, "technical": 83, "overall": 64}, "reasoning": "Valuation is slightly above neutral due to modest z-scores. Quality is strong with high profitability metrics. Income is neutral as data is missing. Balance shows some leverage concerns but liquidity is decent. Technicals are strong with positive trends and low volatility."}
