{"scores": {"valuation": 66, "quality": 50, "income": 40, "balance": 30, "technical": 80, "overall": 53}, "reasoning": "Valuation is decent with positive z-scores, while quality metrics are mixed with low operating margins. Income is weak due to a negative dividend yield z-score. Balance shows high leverage and poor liquidity ratios. Technicals are strong with high oscillator and market strength z-scores, indicating positive momentum. Overall score reflects a blend of these factors."}
