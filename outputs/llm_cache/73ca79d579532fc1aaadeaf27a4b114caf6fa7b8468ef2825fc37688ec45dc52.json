{"scores": {"valuation": 61, "quality": 66, "income": 79, "balance": 30, "technical": 50, "overall": 57}, "reasoning": "Valuation is decent with positive z-scores, indicating relative cheapness. Quality metrics show solid profitability but not exceptional. Income is strong with a high dividend yield. Balance sheet shows high leverage and weak liquidity, pulling the score down. Technicals are mixed, with some positive trends but overall neutral positioning. Overall score reflects a blend of these factors."}
