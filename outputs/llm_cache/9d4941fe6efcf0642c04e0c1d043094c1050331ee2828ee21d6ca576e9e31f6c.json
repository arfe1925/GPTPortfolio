{"scores": {"valuation": 66, "quality": 61, "income": 40, "balance": 30, "technical": 50, "overall": 49}, "reasoning": "Valuation is solid with favorable z-scores. Quality metrics indicate decent profitability but not exceptional. Income score is low due to negative dividend yield z-score. Balance shows high leverage and weak liquidity, leading to a low score. Technicals are mixed, with some positive trends but overall neutral. Overall score reflects these mixed signals."}
