{"scores": {"valuation": 54, "quality": 73, "income": 50, "balance": 43, "technical": 80, "overall": 64}, "reasoning": "Valuation is slightly above neutral due to modest z-scores. Quality shows strong profitability metrics, leading to a good score. Income is neutral as data is missing. Balance is penalized by high leverage despite decent liquidity. Technicals are strong with positive trends and positioning, resulting in a high score. Overall reflects a blend of these scores."}
