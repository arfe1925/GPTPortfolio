{"scores": {"valuation": 66, "quality": 0, "income": 50, "balance": 10, "technical": 30, "overall": 31}, "reasoning": "Valuation is decent due to low price ratios. Quality is poor with negative profitability metrics. Income is neutral as data is missing. Balance shows high leverage and low liquidity, scoring low. Technicals indicate weak trends and volatility, leading to a low score. Overall score reflects the combination of these factors."}
