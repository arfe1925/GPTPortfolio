{"scores": {"valuation": 53, "quality": 54, "income": 40, "balance": 61, "technical": 76, "overall": 57}, "reasoning": "Valuation is slightly above neutral due to modest z-scores. Quality metrics show mixed results, with ROE and ROA being decent but margins lagging. Income is weak with a negative dividend yield z-score. Balance is better, with a high debt-to-equity ratio offset by decent liquidity ratios. Technicals are strong, indicating a favorable trend and position."}
