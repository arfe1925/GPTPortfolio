{"scores": {"valuation": 61, "quality": 0, "income": 50, "balance": 0, "technical": 50, "overall": 32}, "reasoning": "Valuation scores are decent due to relative pricing metrics. Quality is poor with negative profitability indicators. Income is neutral as data is missing. Balance shows high leverage and low liquidity, leading to a low score. Technicals are mixed, with some positive trends but overall neutral. Overall score reflects the weak quality and balance metrics."}
