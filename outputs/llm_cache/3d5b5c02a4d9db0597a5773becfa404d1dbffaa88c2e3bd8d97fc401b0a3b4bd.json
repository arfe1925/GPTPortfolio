{"scores": {"valuation": 62, "quality": 50, "income": 50, "balance": 20, "technical": 85, "overall": 53}, "reasoning": "Valuation is decent but not strong due to moderate z-scores. Quality metrics are mixed, with ROE being positive but others lagging. Income is neutral as data is missing. Balance is weak due to high leverage. Technicals are strong, indicating positive momentum and trend. Overall score reflects a blend of these factors."}
