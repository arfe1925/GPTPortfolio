{"scores": {"valuation": 66, "quality": 20, "income": 50, "balance": 50, "technical": 80, "overall": 53}, "reasoning": "Valuation is solid with favorable ratios, but quality metrics are poor, indicating unsustainable profitability. Income is neutral due to missing data. Balance shows moderate leverage concerns, while technicals are strong, suggesting positive momentum. Overall score reflects mixed signals, weighted towards valuation and technicals."}
