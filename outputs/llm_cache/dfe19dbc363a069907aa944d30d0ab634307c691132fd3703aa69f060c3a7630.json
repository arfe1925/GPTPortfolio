{"scores": {"valuation": 66, "quality": 61, "income": 50, "balance": 50, "technical": 54, "overall": 56}, "reasoning": "Valuation is solid with positive z-scores, indicating cheaper relative pricing. Quality is decent due to strong ROA but penalized by negative margins. Income is neutral as data is missing. Balance shows high leverage and weak liquidity, leading to a conservative score. Technicals are mixed, with some positive trends but overall low z-scores. Overall score reflects a blend of these factors."}
