{"scores": {"valuation": 50, "quality": 85, "income": 80, "balance": 30, "technical": 30, "overall": 53}, "reasoning": "Valuation is neutral due to mixed z-scores. Quality is strong with high ROE and ROA. Income is solid with a high dividend yield. Balance is weak due to high debt and low liquidity ratios. Technical indicators show weakness in momentum and volatility. Overall score reflects strong quality and income but penalized by balance and technical weaknesses."}
