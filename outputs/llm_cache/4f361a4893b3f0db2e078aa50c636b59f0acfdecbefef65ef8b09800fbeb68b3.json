{"scores": {"valuation": 54, "quality": 75, "income": 50, "balance": 30, "technical": 50, "overall": 52}, "reasoning": "Valuation is slightly better than neutral due to price-to-sales. Quality is strong with high ROE and margins. Income is neutral as data is missing. Balance is weak with high debt and low liquidity ratios. Technicals are mixed but overall neutral. Overall score reflects a blend of these factors."}
