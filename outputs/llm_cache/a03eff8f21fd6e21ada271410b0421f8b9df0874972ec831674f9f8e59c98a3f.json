{"scores": {"valuation": 0, "quality": 0, "income": 50, "balance": 0, "technical": 70, "overall": 30}, "reasoning": "Valuation is poor due to high price-to-book ratio. Quality metrics are weak with negative z-scores in margins. Income is neutral as no data is available. Balance shows high leverage and low liquidity, resulting in a low score. Technicals are relatively better, with a positive position within the monthly range, leading to a higher score there."}
