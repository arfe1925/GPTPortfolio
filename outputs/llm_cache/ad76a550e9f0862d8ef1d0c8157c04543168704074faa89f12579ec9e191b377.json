{"scores": {"valuation": 60, "quality": 70, "income": 50, "balance": 40, "technical": 50, "overall": 54}, "reasoning": "Valuation is decent with a positive z-score. Quality shows strong ROA but poor margins. Income is neutral due to missing data. Balance is weak with low liquidity ratios. Technicals are mixed, with a decent oscillator but poor position metrics. Overall score reflects a blend of these factors."}
