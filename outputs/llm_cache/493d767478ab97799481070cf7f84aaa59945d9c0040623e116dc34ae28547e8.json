{"scores": {"valuation": 66, "quality": 0, "income": 50, "balance": 30, "technical": 70, "overall": 49}, "reasoning": "Valuation is decent due to low price ratios. Quality is poor with negative profitability metrics. Income is neutral with a low dividend yield. Balance is weak due to high leverage and low liquidity. Technicals show a strong position within the monthly range but mixed signals overall. Overall score reflects the balance of these factors."}
