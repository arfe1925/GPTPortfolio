{"scores": {"valuation": 50, "quality": 85, "income": 50, "balance": 40, "technical": 40, "overall": 53}, "reasoning": "Valuation is neutral due to mixed z-scores. Quality is strong with high profitability metrics. Income is neutral as data is missing. Balance is weak due to high leverage and low liquidity ratios. Technicals are also weak with negative trends. Overall score reflects strong quality but weaknesses in balance and technicals."}
