{"scores": {"valuation": 50, "quality": 30, "income": 30, "balance": 70, "technical": 20, "overall": 40}, "reasoning": "Quality and income scores are low due to negative z-scores in margins and dividend yield. Balance is decent with strong liquidity ratios, while valuation is neutral due to lack of data. Technical indicators are weak, reflecting poor trend and volatility. Overall score reflects the balance of these factors."}
