{"scores": {"valuation": 50, "quality": 30, "income": 20, "balance": 40, "technical": 80, "overall": 44}, "reasoning": "Valuation is neutral due to mixed z-scores. Quality is low with negative profitability metrics. Income is weak with a low dividend yield. Balance is slightly better but still concerning due to high debt. Technicals are strong, indicating positive momentum. Overall score reflects the balance of these factors."}
