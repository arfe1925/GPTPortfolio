{"scores": {"valuation": 66, "quality": 60, "income": 50, "balance": 40, "technical": 55, "overall": 54}, "reasoning": "Valuation is strong due to favorable z-scores. Quality is decent despite negative operating margins. Income is neutral as data is missing. Balance is weak due to high debt and low liquidity ratios. Technicals show mixed signals with some positive trends but overall low oscillator strength."}
