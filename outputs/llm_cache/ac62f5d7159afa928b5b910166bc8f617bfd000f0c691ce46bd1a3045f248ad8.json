{"scores": {"valuation": 56, "quality": 30, "income": 40, "balance": 40, "technical": 60, "overall": 45}, "reasoning": "Valuation is mixed with a decent price-to-sales ratio but high price-to-book. Quality metrics are low, indicating weak profitability. Income is below average due to low dividend yield. Balance shows high leverage and poor liquidity. Technicals are moderately positive, with some strength in trends. Overall score reflects a blend of these factors, leaning towards neutral."}
