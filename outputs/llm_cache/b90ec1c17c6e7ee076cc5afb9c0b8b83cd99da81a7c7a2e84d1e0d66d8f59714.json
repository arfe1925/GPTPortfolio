{"scores": {"valuation": 66, "quality": 61, "income": 40, "balance": 30, "technical": 50, "overall": 49}, "reasoning": "Valuation is decent with positive z-scores, indicating relative cheapness. Quality metrics show moderate profitability but not strong enough for high scores. Income is low due to a negative dividend yield z-score. Balance is weak with high debt and low liquidity ratios. Technicals are mixed, with some positive trends but overall neutral positioning."}
