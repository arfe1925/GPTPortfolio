{"scores": {"valuation": 66, "quality": 30, "income": 50, "balance": 20, "technical": 80, "overall": 53}, "reasoning": "Valuation is decent due to a relatively low price-to-book ratio. Quality scores low due to negative margins. Income is neutral as data is missing. Balance is weak with high debt and low liquidity ratios. Technical shows strong positioning within the monthly range and favorable distance from lows, boosting the score."}
