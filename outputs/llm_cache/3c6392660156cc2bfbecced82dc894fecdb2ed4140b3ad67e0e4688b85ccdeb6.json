{"scores": {"valuation": 30, "quality": 50, "income": 50, "balance": 50, "technical": 70, "overall": 50}, "reasoning": "Valuation is low due to high price-to-book ratio. Quality metrics are mixed, with operating margins slightly above average. Income metrics are missing, leading to a neutral score. Balance shows high debt levels, but liquidity ratios are average. Technical indicators suggest a favorable position within the monthly range, boosting the score."}
