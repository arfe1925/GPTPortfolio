{"scores": {"valuation": 61, "quality": 24, "income": 66, "balance": 45, "technical": 66, "overall": 52}, "reasoning": "Valuation is decent due to relatively low price ratios. Quality metrics are weak, indicating poor profitability. Income is supported by a solid dividend yield. Balance shows high leverage and weak liquidity. Technicals are mixed but show some positive trends. Overall score reflects a blend of these factors, leaning towards neutral."}
