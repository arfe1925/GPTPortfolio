{"scores": {"valuation": 70, "quality": 30, "income": 40, "balance": 20, "technical": 50, "overall": 42}, "reasoning": "Valuation is strong due to low price-to-book ratio. Quality is weak with negative margins. Income is slightly below average with low dividend yield. Balance is poor due to high debt and low liquidity ratios. Technicals are mixed, with some positive indicators but overall weak momentum. Overall score reflects a blend of these factors."}
