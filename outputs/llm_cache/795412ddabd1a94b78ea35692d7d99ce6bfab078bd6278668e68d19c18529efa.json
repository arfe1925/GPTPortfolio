{"scores": {"valuation": 66, "quality": 50, "income": 54, "balance": 30, "technical": 66, "overall": 53}, "reasoning": "Valuation is strong due to low price ratios. Quality is neutral as profitability metrics are negative. Income is slightly positive with a decent yield. Balance is weak due to high leverage and low liquidity ratios. Technicals show a positive trend and moderate volatility. Overall score reflects a blend of these factors."}
