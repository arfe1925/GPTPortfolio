{"scores": {"valuation": 66, "quality": 66, "income": 84, "balance": 30, "technical": 70, "overall": 63}, "reasoning": "Valuation is decent but not strong. Quality metrics indicate solid profitability. Income is strong with a high dividend yield. Balance is weak due to high leverage and low liquidity. Technicals show a favorable trend and position. Overall score reflects a blend of these factors."}
