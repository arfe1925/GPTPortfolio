{"scores": {"valuation": 66, "quality": 10, "income": 50, "balance": 40, "technical": 70, "overall": 47}, "reasoning": "Valuation is decent due to a low price-to-book ratio. Quality is poor with negative ROE and ROA. Income is neutral as data is missing. Balance shows high debt and low liquidity ratios, leading to a low score. Technicals are strong with a good position within the monthly range, boosting the score."}
