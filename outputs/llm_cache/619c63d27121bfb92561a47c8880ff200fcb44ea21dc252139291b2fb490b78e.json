{"scores": {"valuation": 66, "quality": 30, "income": 30, "balance": 50, "technical": 60, "overall": 47}, "reasoning": "Valuation is solid with decent pricing ratios. Quality metrics are weak, indicating low profitability. Income is also low due to a negative dividend yield z-score. Balance shows moderate leverage but acceptable liquidity. Technicals are mixed, with some positive trends but overall volatility concerns. Overall score reflects the balance of these factors."}
