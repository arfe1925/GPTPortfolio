{"scores": {"valuation": 66, "quality": 54, "income": 30, "balance": 20, "technical": 40, "overall": 42}, "reasoning": "Valuation is strong with decent z-scores, while quality metrics show mixed results. Income is weak due to a low dividend yield z-score. Balance is negatively impacted by high leverage. Technicals are also weak, with poor oscillator and position metrics. Overall score reflects a blend of these factors."}
