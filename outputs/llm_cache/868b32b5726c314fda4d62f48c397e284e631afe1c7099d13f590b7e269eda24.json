{"scores": {"valuation": 56, "quality": 83, "income": 53, "balance": 66, "technical": 40, "overall": 59}, "reasoning": "Valuation is slightly above neutral due to modest z-scores. Quality is strong with high profitability metrics. Income is neutral with a low dividend yield z-score. Balance shows good liquidity but moderate leverage. Technicals are weak, with negative trends in position and volatility. Overall score reflects a blend of these factors."}
