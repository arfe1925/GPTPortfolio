{"scores": {"valuation": 66, "quality": 54, "income": 30, "balance": 43, "technical": 62, "overall": 51}, "reasoning": "Valuation is solid with favorable z-scores. Quality metrics are mixed, with some profitability indicators below average. Income is weak due to a low dividend yield z-score. Balance shows high leverage and weak liquidity ratios. Technicals are moderately positive, indicating some strength. Overall, the scores reflect a cautious outlook with strengths in valuation and technicals but weaknesses in income and balance."}
