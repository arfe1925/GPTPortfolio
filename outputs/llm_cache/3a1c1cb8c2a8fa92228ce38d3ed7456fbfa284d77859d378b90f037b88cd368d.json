{"scores": {"valuation": 50, "quality": 0, "income": 50, "balance": 0, "technical": 60, "overall": 32}, "reasoning": "Valuation is neutral due to mixed z-scores. Quality is poor with negative profitability metrics. Income is neutral as data is missing. Balance is weak with high leverage and low liquidity. Technical shows some strength in positioning but overall is weak. Overall score reflects the poor quality and balance metrics."}
