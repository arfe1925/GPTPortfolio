{"scores": {"valuation": 70, "quality": 70, "income": 40, "balance": 50, "technical": 60, "overall": 58}, "reasoning": "Valuation is strong with favorable price ratios. Quality metrics indicate decent profitability but not exceptional. Income is weak due to a negative dividend yield z-score. Balance shows high leverage, which is concerning, while liquidity is neutral. Technicals are mixed, with strong RSI but poor monthly position. Overall score reflects a blend of these factors."}
