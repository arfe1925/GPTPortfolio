{"scores": {"valuation": 66, "quality": 73, "income": 40, "balance": 50, "technical": 75, "overall": 61}, "reasoning": "Valuation is solid with favorable price ratios. Quality metrics indicate good profitability but not exceptional. Income is weak due to low dividend yield. Balance shows high leverage and poor liquidity, which is concerning.
