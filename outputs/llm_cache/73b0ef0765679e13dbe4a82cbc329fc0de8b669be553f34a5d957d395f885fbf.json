{"scores": {"valuation": 66, "quality": 30, "income": 20, "balance": 50, "technical": 70, "overall": 47}, "reasoning": "Valuation is solid with low ratios, but quality and income metrics are weak, indicating poor profitability and low dividend yield. Balance is neutral due to high debt, while technicals show a strong position within the monthly range and low volatility. Overall score reflects the mixed signals, leaning towards valuation strength but offset by quality and income weaknesses."}
