{"scores": {"valuation": 66, "quality": 40, "income": 30, "balance": 50, "technical": 75, "overall": 52}, "reasoning": "Valuation is decent with positive z-scores, but quality and income metrics are weak, indicating profitability issues. Balance is neutral due to high debt and low liquidity ratios. Technicals show strong momentum and trend, boosting the overall score."}
