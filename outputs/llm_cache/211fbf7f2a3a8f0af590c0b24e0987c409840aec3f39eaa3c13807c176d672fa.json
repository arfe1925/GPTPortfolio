{"scores": {"valuation": 66, "quality": 67, "income": 50, "balance": 10, "technical": 83, "overall": 55}, "reasoning": "Valuation is decent with positive z-scores, quality metrics show strong ROE and margins but weak ROA. Income is neutral due to missing data. Balance is weak due to high leverage. Technicals are strong with high oscillator and favorable position. Overall score reflects mixed signals, weighted towards strengths in valuation, quality, and technicals."}
