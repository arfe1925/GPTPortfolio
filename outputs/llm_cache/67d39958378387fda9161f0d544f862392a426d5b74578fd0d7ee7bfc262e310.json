{"scores": {"valuation": 61, "quality": 30, "income": 50, "balance": 40, "technical": 60, "overall": 48}, "reasoning": "Valuation is decent with positive z-scores, but quality metrics are weak due to negative margins. Income is neutral as data is missing. Balance shows high leverage and poor liquidity ratios, leading to a low score. Technicals are mixed, with some positive trends but overall low z-scores. Overall score reflects the balance of these factors."}
