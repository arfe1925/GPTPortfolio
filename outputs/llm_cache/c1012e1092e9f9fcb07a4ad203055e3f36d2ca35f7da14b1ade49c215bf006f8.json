{"scores": {"valuation": 75, "quality": 20, "income": 50, "balance": 30, "technical": 60, "overall": 53}, "reasoning": "Valuation is strong due to low price ratios. Quality is weak with negative profitability metrics. Income is neutral as no data is available. Balance is poor with high leverage and low liquidity. Technical shows a decent trend but mixed signals. Overall score reflects strong valuation offset by quality and balance weaknesses."}
