{"scores": {"valuation": 50, "quality": 60, "income": 50, "balance": 90, "technical": 50, "overall": 60}, "reasoning": "Valuation is neutral due to mixed z-scores. Quality shows decent efficiency but not strong profitability. Income is neutral as data is missing. Balance is strong with low leverage and high liquidity. Technicals are mixed, with some positive trends but overall neutral. Overall score reflects a blend of these factors."}
