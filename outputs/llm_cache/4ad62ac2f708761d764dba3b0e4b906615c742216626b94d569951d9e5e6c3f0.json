{"scores": {"valuation": 55, "quality": 30, "income": 40, "balance": 40, "technical": 50, "overall": 43}, "reasoning": "Valuation is slightly favorable due to a better price-to-sales ratio. Quality metrics are weak, with low profitability indicators. Income is neutral with a low dividend yield. Balance shows high leverage and poor liquidity ratios. Technicals are mixed, with some positive positioning but overall weak trend indicators. Overall score reflects a blend of these factors."}
