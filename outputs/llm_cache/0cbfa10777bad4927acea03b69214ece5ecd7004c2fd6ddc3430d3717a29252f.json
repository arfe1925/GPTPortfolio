{"scores": {"valuation": 30, "quality": 60, "income": 50, "balance": 90, "technical": 60, "overall": 58}, "reasoning": "Valuation is low due to high price-to-sales ratio. Quality shows mixed signals with decent operating margins but low ROE. Income is neutral with a low dividend yield. Balance is strong with low debt and high liquidity ratios. Technicals are mixed but show some positive trends. Overall score reflects a blend of these factors."}
