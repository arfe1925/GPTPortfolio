{"scores": {"valuation": 66, "quality": 10, "income": 50, "balance": 40, "technical": 70, "overall": 47}, "reasoning": "Valuation is decent with positive z-scores, but quality metrics are weak, indicating poor profitability. Income is neutral due to missing data. Balance shows high leverage and low liquidity, which is concerning. Technicals are relatively strong, suggesting a favorable trend. Overall, the mixed signals lead to a conservative overall score."}
