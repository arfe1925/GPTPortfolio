{"scores": {"valuation": 42, "quality": 69, "income": 50, "balance": 36, "technical": 54, "overall": 50}, "reasoning": "Valuation is low due to a higher price-to-book ratio. Quality is decent with good ebitda margins. Income is neutral as data is missing. Balance shows high leverage and poor liquidity ratios. Technicals are mixed with some positive trends but overall volatility is moderate."}
