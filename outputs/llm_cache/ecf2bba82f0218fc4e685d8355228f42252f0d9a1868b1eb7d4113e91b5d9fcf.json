{"scores": {"valuation": 61, "quality": 0, "income": 50, "balance": 37, "technical": 76, "overall": 45}, "reasoning": "Valuation is decent due to a relatively low price-to-book ratio. Quality is poor with negative ROE and ROA. Income is neutral as data is missing. Balance shows high leverage and weak liquidity ratios. Technicals are strong with a favorable position within the monthly range, boosting the score. Overall score reflects the mixed signals, weighted towards the weaknesses."}
