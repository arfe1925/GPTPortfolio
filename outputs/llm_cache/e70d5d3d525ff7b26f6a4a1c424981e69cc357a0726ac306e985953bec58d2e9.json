{"scores": {"valuation": 55, "quality": 50, "income": 85, "balance": 30, "technical": 60, "overall": 54}, "reasoning": "Valuation is mixed with a slight edge due to price-to-sales. Quality is average with some positive signals but also negatives. Income is strong with a high dividend yield. Balance is weak due to high debt and low liquidity ratios. Technicals show a mixed trend but some positive positioning. Overall score reflects a blend of these factors."}
