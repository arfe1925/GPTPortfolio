{"scores": {"valuation": 45, "quality": 20, "income": 50, "balance": 20, "technical": 40, "overall": 35}, "reasoning": "Valuation is low due to negative z-scores in price ratios. Quality metrics are poor with negative profitability indicators. Income is neutral as no data is available. Balance shows high leverage and low liquidity, resulting in a low score. Technical indicators are mixed but lean negative, leading to a conservative overall score."}
