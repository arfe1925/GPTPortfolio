{"scores": {"valuation": 64, "quality": 50, "income": 50, "balance": 30, "technical": 70, "overall": 53}, "reasoning": "Valuation is solid with favorable z-scores. Quality shows mixed signals, with ROE strong but margins weak. Income is neutral due to low dividend yield z-score. Balance is weak due to high debt and low liquidity ratios. Technicals are positive, indicating a constructive trend. Overall score reflects a blend of these factors."}
