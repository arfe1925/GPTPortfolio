{"scores": {"valuation": 61, "quality": 73, "income": 49, "balance": 50, "technical": 70, "overall": 63}, "reasoning": "Valuation is decent but not strong. Quality metrics indicate good profitability. Income score is low due to negative dividend yield z-score. Balance is neutral with high debt. Technicals show a strong position within the monthly range but mixed signals elsewhere. Overall score reflects a blend of these factors."}
