{"scores": {"valuation": 54, "quality": 73, "income": 50, "balance": 45, "technical": 70, "overall": 58}, "reasoning": "Valuation is slightly above neutral due to a decent price-to-book ratio. Quality scores well with strong ebitda margins. Income is neutral as data is missing. Balance is weak due to high debt and low liquidity ratios. Technical shows a strong position within the monthly range and good market strength, contributing positively."}
