{"scores": {"valuation": 66, "quality": 61, "income": 50, "balance": 54, "technical": 50, "overall": 56}, "reasoning": "Valuation is solid with favorable z-scores. Quality metrics indicate decent profitability but not exceptional. Income is neutral due to missing data. Balance shows moderate leverage and liquidity. Technicals are mixed, with some positive trends but overall weak signals. Overall score reflects a blend of these factors."}
